# SurplusLink Comprehensive Developer Documentation

SurplusLink is a hyper-local food rescue ecosystem designed to eliminate food waste by bridging the gap between donors, NGOs, and volunteers through real-time logistics and intelligent matching algorithms.

---

## 1. System Architecture & High-Level Design

### **Core Philosophical Principles**
- **Hyper-Locality**: Uses Geospatial indexing (2dsphere) to prioritize matches within a 5-15km radius.
- **Safety First**: Implements strict timing buffers (e.g., no pickups within 30 mins of expiry).
- **Transparency**: Proof-of-delivery via photo uploads and public trust scores for donors.

### **Integrated Tech Stack**
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React 18 + Vite | SPA architecture for high performance. |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI | Modern, accessible, and premium design system. |
| **State** | React Context API | Global authentication and notification state. |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express | RESTful API with modular routing. |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas | Document storage with Geospatial capabilities. |
| **Files** | Cloudinary | Secure storage for POD (Proof of Delivery) images. |
| **Auth** | JWT + HttpOnly Cookies | Secure cross-site session management. |
| **Maps** | Google Maps API | Route optimization and geocoding. |

## 2. Database Schema (Deep Dive)

### **User Entity**
- `role`: (`donor`, `ngo`, `volunteer`, `admin`).
- `status`: (`pending`, `active`, `deactivated`).
- `organization`: Name of the business/NGO.
- `volunteerProfile`: 
    - `vehicleType`: (Cycle, Bike, Car, Van).
    - `capacity`: Max weight in kg.
    - `currentLocation`: GeoJSON Point (updated in real-time).
- `trustScore`: Calculated from user feedback and completion rates.

### **Donation Entity**
- `status`: (`active`, `assigned`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `expired`).
- `deliveryStatus`: (`idle`, `pending_pickup`, `at_pickup`, `in_transit`, `delivered`).
- `storageReq`: (`ambient`, `chilled`, `frozen`).
- `perishability`: (High, Medium, Low).
- `coordinates`: GeoJSON Point (Pickup location).
- `photos`: Array of Cloudinary URLs.
- `feedback`: Rating and comments from the recipient NGO.

## 4. Intelligent Features (The "Engine")

### **1. Suitability Scoring Algorithm**
Uses a weighted matrix to rank NGOs for a donation:
- **Proximity (40%)**: Distance via Haversine formula.
- **Capacity (30%)**: Matches donation volume to NGO daily limits.
- **Urgency (20%)**: Distance to expiry date.
- **Match Rate (10%)**: NGO's historical acceptance of similar food types.

### **2. Logistics Auto-Dispatch (Tiered Notification)**
When an NGO claims a donation:
- **Minute 0**: Notify top 3 closest volunteers.
- **Minute 2**: Open mission to all volunteers in 10km.
- **Minute 5**: Radius expansion to 20km automatically.

### **3. Safety Supervisor (Cron Jobs)**
- **Mission Reassignment**: If a volunteer is inactive (no GPS update) for 15 mins while on a mission, the system automatically unassigns them and re-dispatches to others to prevent food spoilage.
